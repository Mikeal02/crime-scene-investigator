# Crime Scene Investigator

**Crime Scene Investigator** is an interactive web application that lets users explore and analyze simulated crime scenes through a clean, responsive UI.  
The app is built with React and TypeScript using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn‑ui.

This project demonstrates modern frontend engineering, UI design, and interactive data exploration.
